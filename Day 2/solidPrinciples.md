# SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Programming

SOLID principles make it easy for a developer to write easily extendable code and avoid common coding errors. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and have become a fundamental part of object-oriented programming. In the context of .NET development, adhering to SOLID principles can lead to more modular, flexible, and maintainable code.

## The Five SOLID Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility. This promotes modularization and makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

**Key Idea**: A class should do only one thing, and it should do it well.

**Real-Time Example**: Think of a chef who only focuses on cooking, not managing the restaurant or delivering food.

**Practical coding example in C#:**

**Before applying SRP**:
```csharp
public class Report
{
    public void GenerateReport() { }
    public void SaveToFile() { }
}
```

In this scenario, the `Report` class has two responsibilities: generating a report and saving it to a file. This violates the SRP.

**After applying SRP**:
```csharp
public class Report
{
    public void GenerateReport() { }
}

public class ReportSaver
{
    public void SaveToFile() { }
}
```

Now, the `Report` class is responsible only for generating reports, while the `ReportSaver` class is responsible for saving reports. Each class has a single responsibility.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open/Closed Principle suggests that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can add new features without altering existing code.

**Key Idea**: Once a class is written, it should be closed for modifications but open for extensions.

**Real-Time Example**: Your smartphone — you don’t open it up to add features; you just download apps to extend its capabilities.

**Practical coding example in C#:**

**Before applying OCP**:
```csharp
public class Rectangle
{
    public double Width { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }
}

public class AreaCalculator
{
    public double CalculateArea(Rectangle rectangle)
    {
        return rectangle.Width * rectangle.Height;
    }
}

```



This design may become problematic when adding new shapes. Modifying the `AreaCalculator` for each new shape violates the OCP.

**After applying OCP**:
```csharp
public interface IShape
{
    double CalculateArea();
}

public class Rectangle : IShape
{
    // implementation
}

public class Circle : IShape
{
    // implementation
}

```

By introducing an interface (`IShape`), new shapes like `Circle` can be added without modifying existing code, adhering to the OCP.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

**Key Idea**: You should be able to use any subclass where you use its parent class.

**Real-Time Example**: You have a remote control that works for all types of TVs, regardless of the brand.

**Practical coding example in C#:**

**Before applying LSP**:
```csharp
public class Bird
{
    public virtual void Fly() { /* implementation */ }
}

public class Penguin : Bird
{
    public override void Fly()
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException("Penguins can't fly!");
    }
}
```

Here, the `Penguin` class violates the LSP by throwing an exception for the `Fly` method.

**After applying LSP**:
```csharp
public interface IFlyable
{
    void Fly();
}

public class Bird : IFlyable
{
    public void Fly()
    {
        // implementation specific to Bird
    }
}

public class Penguin : IFlyable
{
    public void Fly()
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException("Penguins can't fly!");
    }
}
```

By introducing the `IFlyable` interface, both `Bird` and `Penguin` adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. This principle encourages the creation of small, client-specific interfaces.

**Key Idea**: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn’t use.

**Real-Time Example**: You sign up for a music streaming service and only choose the genres you like, not all available genres.

**Practical coding example in C#:**

**Before applying ISP**:
```csharp
public interface IWorker
{
    void Work();
    void Eat();
}

public class Manager : IWorker
{
    // implementation
}

public class Robot : IWorker
{
    // implementation
}
```
The `Robot` class is forced to implement the `Eat` method, violating ISP.

**After applying ISP**:
```csharp
public interface IWorkable
{
    void Work();
}

public interface IEatable
{
    void Eat();
}

public class Manager : IWorkable, IEatable
{
    // implementation
}

public class Robot : IWorkable
{
    // implementation
}
```
By splitting the `IWorker` interface into smaller interfaces (`IWorkable` and `IEatable`), classes can implement only what they need, adhering to ISP.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The Dependency Inversion Principle suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

**Key Idea**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

**Real-Time Example**: Building a LEGO tower — the bricks (high and low-level modules) connect through smaller bricks (abstractions).

**Practical coding example in C#:**

**Before applying DIP**:
```csharp
public class LightBulb
{
    public void TurnOn() { /* implementation */ }
    public void TurnOff() { /* implementation */ }
}

public class Switch
{
    private LightBulb bulb;

    public Switch(LightBulb bulb)
    {
        this.bulb = bulb;
    }

    public void Toggle()
    {
        if (bulb.IsOn)
            bulb.TurnOff();
        else
            bulb.TurnOn();
    }
}
```

The `Switch` class directly depends on the concrete `LightBulb` class, violating DIP.

**After applying DIP**:
```csharp
public interface ISwitchable
{
    void TurnOn();
    void TurnOff();
}

public class LightBulb : ISwitchable
{
    // implementation
}

public class Switch
{
    private ISwitchable device;

    public Switch(ISwitchable device)
    {
        this.device = device;
    }

    public void Toggle()
    {
        if (device.IsOn)
            device.TurnOff();
        else
            device.TurnOn();
    }
}
```
By introducing an interface (`ISwitchable`), the `Switch` class now depends on an abstraction, adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.
